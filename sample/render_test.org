Here I'll be testing render

* Top level heading

# ------8<---------
** Subheadings for the inputs
And some template here: mean is {mean}, and sd is {sd}.
# ------8<---------

Then we have other things

* Another top level heading
# ------8<---------
** Another Subheadings for the inputs
And again mean is {mean}, and sd is {sd}.
# ------8<---------

And finally we'll end here.
