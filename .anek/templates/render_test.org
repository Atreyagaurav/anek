Here I'll be testing render

* Top level heading

# ------8<---------
** Subheadings for the inputs
And some template here: mean is {mean}, and sd is {sd}.
# ------8<---------

Then we have other things

* Another top level heading
We can even do fancy things like table, it's all about templates:

| Mean  | SD   |
|-------+------|
# ------8<---------
|{mean} | {sd} |
# ------8<---------

And finally we'll end here.
